HOW TO GIT:

Change any files you want. When you're ready to send the changes to the server, do the following.

1) Open Git Bash. You can do this by navigating in Windows Explorer to the folder where the files are contained, right click, and select "GIT BASH HERE"

2) Type:     git status
   This will show you the files you changed

3) Did you double click the python file? If not, double click the python file and do step (2) again.

4) For each file you changed, you need to run:
   git add filename.filextension

   If you changed the texture directory, you can just run

   git add textures

5) type git status
   Everything you changed should be in greed. If not, add the files until everything is green.

6) Type: git commit -m "This is a message describing my changes"

7) Type: git push
